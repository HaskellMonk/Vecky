Vecky
=====

Vecky is an expression template vector library for small vectors. 
Expression templates allow for high performance code with easy to use syntax. Vecky was written as part of a 
cuda accelerated ray tracer and therefore all functions can be called in cuda device code. 
Vecky is a header only library and can just be copied into your src directory and included with #include "Vecky.hpp"
